# postgresql-Api-Example

typescript tutorial with postgresql and prisma. Never worked with typescript really. Figuring what all the hype is about.

Doing a refresher building a simple api, only this time I'm doing it with postgresql and using an ORM in prisma.

Prisma is a can-do all ORM/ODM that can also replace mongoose for mongo. Interesting.

Will see as I build this out then figure out how to optimize the crap out of this by integrating some unecessary services in AWS SQS and stuff. Maybe also move from .env to SSM Parameter Store? The world's my oyster, I suppose.
